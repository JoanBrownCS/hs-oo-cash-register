### Cha Ching!
<img src="https://after-school-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/cash_register.gif" alt="Cash Register" height="200" align="right" hspace="20"> You're going to create an object-oriented cash register than can add items of varying quantities and prices, calculate discounts, and keep track of what's been added to it.

### Instructions
Follow along with the specs in `spec/cash_register_spec.rb`. Remember to run your specs in the terminal by entering `rspec` from the main directory of this lab.

Write your code in the `cash_register.rb` file.

Take it one step at a time, peeps!

### Bonus
Build a method called `void_last_transaction` that will remove the last transaction from the total. You'll need to make an additional attribute accessor and keep track of that last transaction amount somehow. Hint: in what method of the class are you working with an individual item?

***And that's all folks!*** You've successfully built an object-oriented cash register!
